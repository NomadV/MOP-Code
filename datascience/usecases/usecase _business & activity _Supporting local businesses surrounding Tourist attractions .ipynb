    "**As a tourist I want to make the most of the time in the city of Melbourne and have a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience.** <br>\n",
    "When visiting Melbourne, tourists are often eager to uncover new and exciting places to visit, in order to add depth and interest to their itinerary. By researching lesser-known attractions or asking locals for recommendations, travelers can discover hidden gems that may not have been on their radar initially. Additionally, it's important to plan one's route effectively in order to avoid wasting time and money on unnecessary transportation. By mapping out a logical itinerary, visitors can ensure that they are able to see as much of the city as possible within their allotted time frame, without missing out on any must-see sights.\n",

    "**As a cafe, restaurant, or bistro owner in Melbourne, I understand the value of catering to tourists who are looking to make the most of their time in the city. By recognizing and responding to the needs and interests of visitors, I can build a loyal customer base and create a sustainable business model that benefits both myself and the local tourism industry.**<br> \n",
    "The primary objective of business owners is to enhance customer engagement and drive revenue growth by delivering an exceptional and unforgettable experience to visitors. This can result in a surge of foot traffic and revenue generation for the cafe, restaurant, and bistro owners. In the end, the aim of business owners is to develop a feasible business model that not only serves their best interests but also provides substantial benefits to their customers and the neighboring community."
